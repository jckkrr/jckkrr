## Case studies 

#### Aviation data

Aviation is a trove of stories waiting to be mined, and there's been no time that this was more exident than during the pandemic. Here's three times of the stories I've used aviation data to unearth. 

### Crown Casinos luxury jets used to deliver COVID aid to the Pacific

- At a time when no one was supposed to be getting in or out of Australia and people in Melbourne weren't meant to leave their homes, Crown Casino's fleet of Bombardier Global Express XRS were surprisingly busy throughout 2020 and 2021. I built bespoke tools to analyse crowd-sourced and unfiltered aviation data, and in combination with other open-source intelligence techniques, discoverd a front-page story for The Age and Sydney Morning Herald.

### Half of Australian airports were busier during pandemic

- By bringing together year's worth of arrival and depature numbers for more than 1,000 Australian airports, I was able to show that the majority were busier during the first financial year post=COVID than the one that directly preceeded its arrival. As I reported for Business Insider, this was largely thanks to FIFO workers in the west driving much of the demand,as well as some internal tourism. 

### Victoria Police helicopters really did target Melbourne's northern suburbs during the pandemic
- I collected and analysed over a million pings sent out by the Victoria Police helicopters during Melbourne's lockdowns years. Was there any truth to the rumoursthat they'd targetted some suburbs? The analysis showed that one council area in the north of Melbourne received disproportionate attention.

#### Gambling investigations
 
### Using cyber intel to show the mega-scale of a Bet365 black market network

- Starting with a single web address, our algorithmic OSINT tools quickly discovered a network of 12,000+ Bet365 sites targeting China - an extraordinary number, even for the world's biggest bookmaker.

### Mapping out European football's gambling problem

- As part of an EU-funded cross-border investigation, we built web-scraping, data-compiling algorithms to find out just how big European football's betting problem is. The results were "frightening".

#### Government data

### Fact checking a premier's spin via a PDF reader

- During the state's recent election, the Victorian premier kept repeating a claim about the state's ambulance response times being at their record best just prior to the pandemic. The available data needed to assess this claim for RMIT ABC Fact Check was stored across multiple quarterly and annual report PDFs published by Ambulance Victoria, and in a complex and inconsistent series of spreadsheets released yearly by the federal Productivity Commission. I built the tools that made this possible.

### Investigative Analytics & Digital OSINT Tools

## :chains: UK COMPANIES HOUSE OFFICER CONNECTIONS CHECKER

The UKCH is an outstanding resource for finding business connections. This tool makes the process more efficient and revealing, by creating network maps of a person's business associates - which then expands to show the associates of those associates. 

Use it now on ![Streamlit](https://jckkrr-uk-companies-house-network-ma-officer-connections-6kwzs0.streamlit.app)

## :airplane: WHO MET WHO? :airplane:

OSINT investigators wish they could get access to flight records. This tool doesn't do that, but it does show which planes landed and took off on the same days from an airport, which can be useful in offering potentially solutions to who was meeting whom.

It applies relational alegbra to the constructed databases built from the Open Sky Network and HexDB.io APIS, in order to return the details on all aircraft that fit the search criteria.
