#### Journalism has always been defined by its access to information. But many journalists (data-averse and/or tech-shy) are only scratching the surface of what secrets can be divined from the greatest research tool that ever existed, the internet.

I launched the <a href="http://constituent.au/" target="_blank">Constituent Investigative Analytics Studio</a> earlier this year in order to help journalists - and those in other democratically related fields, such as law and politics - to weaponise public and publicly available data for good, so they can make a bigger difference in their fields.

### RECENT PROJECTS

### Using police helicopter pings to show which suburbs were targeted during lockdown
I harvested, visualised and analysed over a million police helicopter pings from the pandemic period. It showed that one council area in the north of Melbourne received disproportionate attention from the air police in that time.

### About me

I am an award-winning investigative journalist and data analyst working at the nexus of the political, cyber and anti-disinformation spaces.

My reporting has been published internationally by The New York Times, The Guardian, Der Spiegel and ESPN, featured in Interpol briefings, had academic papers published and produced front page investigations for The Age. I spent close to two-decades with the ABC, including most recently as digital editor and data consultant on election integrity projects for its prestigious fact checking unit.

With a Master of Commercial Law from the University of Melbourne and a range of technical and programming qualifications, I am committed to pushing the field of investigative analytics forward, enabling greater access to data for leading organisations across democratically-aligned fields such as media, politics and law, and recently received funding from an EU-affiliated body to carry out such work.

In short, I am an insights-seeking, facts-driven analyst and storyteller with a forensic eye for getting to the bottom of what is really going on - and
