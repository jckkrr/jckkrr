## Case studies 

### Mining aviation data for cronyism,police harrassments and mining trends




### :helicopter: POLICE PINGS MAPPER

I collected and analysed over a million pings sent out by the Victoria Police helicopters during Melbourne's lockdowns years. Was there any truth to the rumoursthat they'd targetted some suburbs? The analysis showed that one council area in the north of Melbourne received disproportionate attention.

### Investigative Analytics & Digital OSINT Tools

## :chains: UK COMPANIES HOUSE OFFICER CONNECTIONS CHECKER

The UKCH is an outstanding resource for finding business connections. This tool makes the process more efficient and revealing, by creating network maps of a person's business associates - which then expands to show the associates of those associates. 

Use it now on ![Streamlit](https://jckkrr-uk-companies-house-network-ma-officer-connections-6kwzs0.streamlit.app)

## :airplane: WHO MET WHO? :airplane:

OSINT investigators wish they could get access to flight records. This tool doesn't do that, but it does show which planes landed and took off on the same days from an airport, which can be useful in offering potentially solutions to who was meeting whom.

It applies relational alegbra to the constructed databases built from the Open Sky Network and HexDB.io APIS, in order to return the details on all aircraft that fit the search criteria.

These are just a taste of the tools we have available. We'd love to tell you moreabout them. Get in touch at studio@constituent.au
