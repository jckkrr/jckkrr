#### OPEN-ACCESS TOOLS
## :chains: UK COMPANIES HOUSE OFFICER CONNECTIONS CHECKER

The UKCH is an outstanding resource for finding business connections. This tool makes the process more efficient and revealing, by creating network maps of a person's business associates - which then expands to show the associates of those associates.

## :airplane: WHO MET WHO? :airplane:

OSINT investigators wish they could get access to flight records. This tool doesn't do that, but it does show which planes landed and took off on the same days from an airport, which can be useful in offering potentially solutions to who was meeting whom.

It applies relational alegbra to the constructed databases built from the Open Sky Network and HexDB.io APIS, in order to return the details on all aircraft that fit the search criteria.

These are just a taste of the tools we have available. We'd love to tell you moreabout them. Get in touch at studio@constituent.au

#### RECENT PROJECTS

### :helicopter: POLICE PINGS MAPPER
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69304112/211272449-3c80d1c2-5bf7-4542-b4f5-9d12a14eba5c.png)

I collected and analysed over a million pings sent out by the Victoria Police helicopters during Melbourne's lockdowns years. Was there any truth to the rumoursthat they'd targetted some suburbs? The analysis showed that one council area in the north of Melbourne received disproportionate attention.

I love using betting data to look for everything from match-fixing to market sentiment

I am an award-winning, New York Times-published investigative analyst and data storyteller, specialising in programmatic open-source intelligence (OSINT). I regularly work on projects in the cyber forensics, anti-disinformation, corporate intelligence, sports integrity, logistics and psephological spaces.

My investigative work has received funding from the European Union, featured in Interpol briefings, informed AUSTRAC‚Äôs research, been broadcast on ABC and made front-page news at The Age. My recently launched Constituent Studio is committed to pushing the field of investigative analytics forward, democratising analytics and translating data into insights for leading institutions across media, law and politics.

As an investigative journalist and data analyst with a masters in law and expertise in programming languages such as Python, I am a natural problem solver and communicator who is passionate about using data to find out what is really going on. I have consistently demonstrated an expertise for discerning patterns, following leads and getting to the bottom of complex problems of significant public interest, and also for translating technological research into clear and incisive analysis of the problems at hand.

My Master of Commercial Law from the University of Melbourne was heavily focussed on data rights and data investigations, and two papers in this area, including one related to fraud committed using cryptocurrency, have been published by a leading international journal. More recently, I have completed a number of certificates in data science fields such as machine learning and relational database certifications from Stanford Online.

In 2022, I worked on election disinformation projects with RMIT ABC Fact Check, including one in collaboration with the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue, and as part of this work, built tools to collect and analyse official data, and through this, we were able to reveal the depths of a senator‚Äôs links to a group found to have spread misinformation.
