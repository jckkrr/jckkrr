## I build algorithmic OSINT tools for investigative journalism.


#### Journalism has always been defined by its access to information, and these days, the masses of publicly available data can be as revealing as the hottest scoop - if you can divine the secrets held within.

The internet is the greatest research tool that has ever existed, and most journalists (data-averse, tech-shy) are only scratching the surface of what they could be getting from it.

As the founder of <a href="http://constituent.au/" target="_blank">Constituent Investigative Analytics Studio</a>, I create tools to weaponise public data for good, so that journalists and the others in the democratic space, such as lawyers, researchers and activists, can make a bigger difference in their fields.

### About me

I am an award-winning investigative journalist and data analyst working at the nexus of the political, cyber and anti-disinformation spaces.

My reporting has been published internationally by The New York Times, The Guardian, Der Spiegel and ESPN, featured in Interpol briefings, had academic papers published and produced front page investigations for The Age. I spent close to two-decades with the ABC, including most recently as digital editor and data consultant on election integrity projects for its prestigious fact checking unit.

With a Master of Commercial Law from the University of Melbourne and a range of technical and programming qualifications, I am committed to pushing the field of investigative analytics forward, enabling greater access to data for leading organisations across democratically-aligned fields such as media, politics and law, and recently received funding from an EU-affiliated body to carry out such work.

In short, I am an insights-seeking, facts-driven analyst and storyteller with a forensic eye for getting to the bottom of what is really going on - and
