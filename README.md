## ✈️ Aviation data ✈️

Aviation is a trove of stories waiting to be mined, and there's been no time that this was more exident than during the pandemic. Here's three times of the stories it has helped me uncover. 

- **I analysed 1,000,000+ pings from police helicopters during Melbourne's lockdowns.** ... and it showed that the rumours were true: they really did spend a disproportionate amount of time over the northern suburbs. Find it at: [constituent.au](http://constituent.au/million_pings_melbourne_lockdown_police_helicopter.html)

- **I revealed that the Australian government hired disgraced Crown Casino's private jets to fly COVID-aid across the Pacific** ... and in combination with other open-source intelligence techniques, discovered a front-page story for The Age and Sydney Morning Herald. Find it at: [The Age](https://www.theage.com.au/national/commonwealth-hires-luxury-crown-executive-jets-to-do-aid-work-in-pacific-20211214-p59hed.html)

- **I found that half of Australia's airports were actaully busier during the pandemic** ... and as I reported for Business Insider, this was largely thanks to FIFO workers in the west driving much of the demand,as well as some internal tourism.

## ⚽ Gambling investigations ⚽
![newplot(102)](https://github.com/jckkrr/jckkrr/assets/69304112/1381f7f6-1c11-4207-be55-3d7a0c262aaa)

The offshore gambling industry is a source of fascination, and of mind-bending stories. Here are three examples of how I've used data to investigate the industry.

- **I investigated a suspected fixed match by comparing its odds to hundreds to those in a decade-long archive** ... and found how extraordinary the match really was. Find it on: ![Github](https://github.com/jckkrr/Unlayering_Oddsportal) 


- **I did a cyber audit on Bet365's network of sites targetting the Chinese black market** ... and this research was then used as part of a federal anti-money-laundering investigation. 

- **I build tools to determine the size of football's offshore betting market** ... and found that 8 per cent of games offered by unregulated bookmakers come from Australia. 


## 🗳️ Government and corporate analytics 🗳️

Make it easier to get data they put barriers around is one of my favourite jobs. Here's three times I did that. 

- **I turned ASIC company records into interactive network maps** ... and discovered just how close a senator was to a disinformation group.

- **I fact-checked a premier's spin via a PDF reader** ... and found that he really was full of spin.

- **I created an interactive public-facing tool to show who is connected in the UK Companies House database** ... which then expands to show the associates of those associates. Find it on ![Streamlit](https://jckkrr-uk-companies-house-network-ma-officer-connections-6kwzs0.streamlit.app)



The UKCH is an outstanding resource for finding business connections. This tool makes the process more efficient and revealing, by creating network maps of a person's business associates - which then expands to show the associates of those associates.

OSINT investigators wish they could get access to flight records. This tool doesn't do that, but it does show which planes landed and took off on the same days from an airport, which can be useful in offering potentially solutions to who was meeting whom.

It applies relational alegbra to the constructed databases built from the Open Sky Network and HexDB.io APIS, in order to return the details on all aircraft that fit the search criteria.
